        <h2>About Me:</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>My name is Joe Lindsey, and I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Hull. I graduated in the class of 2020 with a Bsc 2:1 grade.
      I have had a passion for computers and the science behind them since I was a young boy, with the initial interest starting with playing RuneScape back in 2007 at the age of
      9, since then, I have built 3 computers for myself and family members, as well as making many different projects throughout my period of study at Secondary School,
      College and finally University. To name some of the projects that I have made during this time would be my dissertation project, a fake news analyser, a C++ Sudoku
      Solver, and an embedded greenhouse monitoring system made in C and Assembly language for a PIC microprocessor board. Outside of education, I have worked on other projects,
      including this website as well as some projects to learn the basics of React.js, Python and Node.js.

    <h2>Current Project:</h2>
    <p>
      Having just finished an internship with the University of Hull's Professor on his personal project threethinggames, i have been working on some small apps and games for friends through lockdown. 
      The internship that i was working on, was to update and add features to an existing full stack web application. This meant that i was working with a ReactJS client (web app) and a Node.JS server with a mongoDB database. All this 
      interfaced with eachother through a custom made API through Express. I added some features that the client wanted adding, such as creating a file upload section to add a custom list of words, the ability to edit an existing event if you were admin
      and adding a word limit to the software. The majority of these features required me to work on both the client and the server in order to have the function working as intended. I also managed to create a C# app for my friends to
      do the weakest link style quiz during the lockdown which had the basic functionality of the TV show The Weakest Link.

    <h2>Future Project:</h2>
    <p>
      My aim in the future would be to create some cool stuff to have as examples to run on the website such as a wordsearch and a sudoku solver as a base example. This would both be fun for me, and also a good interactive way to show some 
      of my skills on this website. As well as this, i am currently in the process of job hunting for a software developer.
