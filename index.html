        <h2>About Me:</h2>
      </div>

    </div>
    <p>My name is Joe Lindsey, and I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Hull. I graduated in the 2020 with a grade of (unknown at this moment).
      I have had a passion for computers and the science behind them since I was a young boy, with the initial intrest starting with playing RuneScape back in 2007 at the age of
      9, since then, I have built 3 computers for myself and family members, as well as making many different projects throughout my period of study at Secondary School,
      College and finally University. To name some of the projects that I have made during this time would be my dissertation project, a fake news analyser, a C++ Sudoku
      Solver, and an embedded greenhouse monitoring system made in C and Assembly language for a PIC microprocessor board. Outside of education, I have worked on other projects,
      including this website as well as some projects to learn the basics of React.js, Python and Node.js.

    <h2>Current Project:</h2>
    <p>
      My current project at this moment in time would be creating and managing this website through GitHub. My aim for this website is to be a hub for everything to do with me, including any projects or
      open source software that i am working on, as well as displaying anything that i am currently doing in my spare time. The first objective for me to hit is to have all of my personal projects and source code avaliable 
      for anyone to download or view through GitHub with a brief description available to read if needed. After that, i would aim to have a working website with some cool features to be working with the final aim to have this project as some 
      sort of blog.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Project:</h2>
    <p>
      My aim in the future after completing this website, would be for me to create some applications using React.js, Python and Java. This is because i am looking to develop more projects in different languages in order to expand my current
      knowledge set. I have already created a foundation for a website based application to show of some cool animation effects that React.js can do.
