      <h2>Dissertation Project - Fake News Analyser</h2>
      <p>
        For my dissertation project, i created a C# program that would analyse an inputted URL and Title from an article, as well as the author of the article. 
        This particular theory came from a MIT article that i read that proposed the language used inside the URL and Title could help identify if an article was 
        fake, or that the article would more likely be biased towards a certain agenda. The algorithm that would do this would be class based conditional statements to check the contents of the title and URL
        and analyse the language and origin of the URL against a preset list of words and websites that have been flagged as fake news, or less reputable.
