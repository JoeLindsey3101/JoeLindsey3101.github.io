        <h2>Dissertation Project - Fake News Analyser</h2>
        <p>
          For my dissertation project, i created a C# program that would analyse
          an inputted URL and Title from an article, as well as the author of
          the article. This particular theory came from a MIT article that i
          read that proposed the language used inside the URL and Title could
          help identify if an article was fake, or that the article would more
          likely be biased towards a certain agenda. The algorithm that would do
          this would be class based conditional statements to check the contents
          of the title and URL and analyse the language and origin of the URL
          against a preset list of words and websites that have been flagged as
          fake news, or less reputable.

        <h2>Source code for this website.</h2>
        <p>This website was made using examples found online from W3Schools and other examples. This combined with my current
          knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript means I've created a website that is not only modern and stylish, but 
          also is very minimal in its design. The website uses modern methods from CSS to create this shadow effect on the flex-box layout I've created, as well as 
          using the flex-box method to create this effect of two boxes side by side with different sizes.

        <h2>Distributed Systems Software</h2>
        <p>For one of my assignments, I was tasked with creating a client server program using .Net ASP, 
          C#. This app was to interact through APIs to create users on the server from requests in the client. 
          This was accomplished by making requests through an API, which would allow the server to connect to multiple
          clients at the same time. The server would also deny access to certain commands unless an API-Key was passed
          as an argument in the header, which would add a layer of security to the software.

        <h2>Visualization Project - Candlestick Chart + Radar Chart</h2>
        <p>
          For my Visualization module that i took, we had to take preset datasets that the professor had given us and display them in a chart or graph of our choosing.
          Personally i decided on using the given Candlestick and radar charts to plot points for the data. I was also tasked with using a python ParaView program
          that could splice and cut 3D rendered data that would show the commonalities between where a heat source begins and the pressure surrounding that area for aeronautical 
          design. The charts however, were created using JavaScript with HTML to display them in a website format, this would allow me to gain experience using JavaScript Libraries such as
          D3.js as well as Google Charts.

        <h2>A Sudoku Solver in C++</h2>
        <p>For this piece of software, we were assigned to create a new C++ Application to solve 6 pre-generated sudoku puzzles. These puzzles could be completed using the 
          naked and hidden singles method of solving sudoku puzzles. This is where you create a "candidate list" for each space in the puzzle, where you have either 1
          single value that could be inputted into the space (naked single) or you would be able to create a single number by comparing all the lists in the adjacent 3x3 cube, row and column
          surrounding that cell and thus having the value to be inputted (hidden single). This is done in C++ by creating an 9x9 array of Cell objects that store the "value" and its candidate list for that value if the value is equal to 0.
          This is then accessed by another class object that scans the surrounding row, column and 3x3 around the current value and created the candidate list, this is then checked to see if the candidate list only has a single value, if so it is 
          inputted, if not, it will cycle through the remaining cells that are empty until the program solves the sudoku puzzle. The assignment also checked the efficiency of the code i have written, with my program solving the sudoku's in as quickly as 0.007 of a second.
